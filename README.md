# **SvelteKit Events App** ðŸ“…

This is an event planning app built using **SvelteKit**. The user can see their current events and is able to add new ones.

The app currently supports server-side rendering (SSR) to fetch events data via the **Events Interface** defined under $lib/server/remote-events.ts, and route-based navigation for different events (e.g., `/eventid`).

## **Getting Started**

### **Recommended Editor and Extensions**

We recommend using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** for this project, as it provides excellent support for SvelteKit development via extensions.

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**  
   If you don't have VS Code installed, you can download it here:  
   [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. **Recommended Extensions for VS Code**  
   This project includs recommended extensions in its workspace settings.
e
   - When you open the project in VS Code, you will be prompted to **"Install All"** recommended extensions.  
     Click **"Install All"** to quickly set up your environment.

   - Alternatively, you can find the recommended extensions by searching **`@recommended`** in the **Extensions pane** in VS Code.

### Running the project

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash

Exercise Goals

This project has some intentional gaps for you to address. Your task is to complete the following improvements and enhancements:

1. Enhancement: Sluggish user experience

    - Problem: The app is slow to load and navigate between routes.
    - Task: Optimize the app page load performance by utilizing SvelteKit's response streaming feature. Do not modify the remote-events.ts file and continue to use it as is.
    - Task: Optimize form submission by showing a loading indicator while the form is being submitted. Use Sveltekit's built-in Progressive enhancement feature for form to do this.

1. Enhancement: No way to edit or delete existing events

    - Problem: There is no way to edit or delete existing events.
    - Task: Add a way to edit existing events. You can use the same form for adding and editing events.
    - Task: Add a way to delete existing events.

1. Bug: User is able to submit a new event in the past

    - Problem: The user is able to submit a new event with a start date in the past.
    - Task: Prevent the user from submitting a new event with a start date in the past and show appropriate feedback to the user.

1. Enhancement: Basic Styles

    - Problem: There are no styles
    - Task: Improve the design of the UI, you may use any UI libraries you prefer or no libraries at all

1. Freestyle (Optional)

    - Task: Add any other features or improvements you like to show off your knowledge.
